# Placer
Design of a Placement,Routing and Timing Engine.

Started on 17th Oct 2020. The idea is to follow UIUC Lecture on VLSI CAD and implement a small placement and a routing Engine to get hands on VLSI CAD.
All good till date.

**27th Oct 2020** -- This project seems to be incredibly hard. I can't figure out a lot of things. I am going ahead with the Routing and the STA part.
I could not design the placement engine as of now. Will definitely do it later.
