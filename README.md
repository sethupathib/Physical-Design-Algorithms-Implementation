# Physical Design Algorithm Implementation & Case Study
Reference -- [**Physical Design Course by Prof. Yao-Wen Chang.**](https://github.com/Daikon-Sun/Physical-Design-for-Nanometer-ICs)

## [**Steiner Tree Routing**](https://github.com/sethupathib/Physical-Design-Algorithms-Implementation/tree/main/Steiner%20Routing)

Steps--
1. Implement Kruskal's MST using DSU.
2. Implement Steiner Tree using MST (A lot more complex than this).


## Case Study

1. [**Register Clustering for Optimal PPA**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3299902.3309753) and [**ISPD Slides.**](http://ispd.cc/slides/2019/2_placement_GracefulReg.pdf)
2. [**Latch Clustering for Optimal PPA**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3437539.3437769) and [**My Slides.**](https://github.com/sethupathib/Physical-Design-Algorithms-Implementation/blob/main/Register%20Clustering/Latch%20Clustering.pdf)
3. [**GPU Accelerated STA**](http://yibolin.com/publications/papers/TIMER_ICCAD2020_Guo.pdf) and [**My Slides.**](https://github.com/sethupathib/Physical-Design-Algorithms-Implementation/tree/main/GPU%20-%20STA)

P.S -- Prof. Yao Wen thinks that these are classical problems. I think it's good for me to start with these since I am very new to EDA and its implementation.
Also, this project is still under development. It turned out to be a lot harder than I thought. (It will take time for me to fully implement this).
